*The sounds of the surrounding forest echo through the dusk filled sky.*

Dad: 	Don't go wandering too far, it's getting late.
Mom:	And remember to stay out of the woods!
Boy:	I'll stay on the path!

Boy:	Wow! 
		Is that a firefly? 
		I've never seen one before! 
		Mabey I can catch it.

Boy: 	It sure is quick. 
		Is it really an insect? 
		Can't let it get away now!

Wisp: 	Of course!
		Any spirt can.
Boy:	Spirit?
Wisp:	Yep!
		You've found you're way to one the homes of the spirits.
		The Whispering Woods.
Boy: 	I'm sorry spirit.
		But I shouldn't be visitning someone elses home now.
		I wasn't supposed to leave my home!
Wisp:	Well mabey I can help.
		You can't leave the same way you came.
		However I think I know a spirit that can find the path you need.
		Lets go find the Hag!
		Oh! 
		By the way I'm Wisp!
		
Eye:	Thanks you for finding my frog!
Eye:    Oh no! Fire Spirit!
Fire:   Your power is now mine! 
		Mwahahaha!
		
Wisp:	How terrible!
		Although this may be fortunate for you.
Boy:	Why would that be?
Wisp:	There is a lantern that can grant what the holder deasires.
		However, it only works if it has enough power within.
		If you capture that fire spirit it may reveal the path to lead you home.
Boy:	Let's go find it then!
